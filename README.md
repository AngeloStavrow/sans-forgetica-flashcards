# Overview

RMIT recently announced a new typeface called [Sans Forgetica](http://sansforgetica.rmit/), designed to help you retain what you read.

It's based on the concept of "desirable difficulty", making your brain do a just enough extra work filling in the blanks to understand what letters you're looking at. While you wouldn't want to read an entire paper set in the typeface, it should help with short passages.

So I got to thinking: why not take the Glitch starter project and turn it into a way to create flashcards, set in this novel new font?

And here we are. Remix, create your own flashcards, and ace those exams!
